# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
Play Tic Tac Toe with this AI

Copy the code from the TTT.py file and paste it into a python file. Run the code and choose an empty position on the 3x3 board. The 3x3 board can be looked at like a two-dimensional array. Each position in the board is like an index. A position of 0,0 represents the top-left corner while a position of 2,2 represents the bottom-right corner.
You will always go first and you represent "X" while the AI represents "O".
